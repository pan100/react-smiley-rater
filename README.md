# React Smiley-Rater component

This component creates a smiley where the mouth angle is a function of a
number between 0 and 100. Also it changes colors.

## Usage

1. Install modules 
    > yarn

2. Check **_package.json_** so that the information is correct.
3. Start example and start coding! 
    > yarn start

4. Bundle with `yarn build`
5. To test if it works correctly in another project you can use npm `npm install -S ../react-npm-component-boilerplate` Note the relative path

E.g. this folder structure
```
    ./workspace/
        MyProject
        react-npm-boilerplate
```
### Extra
* If you want to run tests: 
    > yarn test

* You need to write tests in `__tests__` folder or as `.test.js`.
* It you want to keep watch run: 
    > yarn test-watch

* If you want coverage run: 
    > yarn test-coverage

* If you want to run eslint: 
    > yarn lint

* If you want to automatically fix lint problems run :

Adjust your `.eslintrc` config file to your own preference.
